I have built a movies list application.\
The home page shows all the movies and a search filter, which filters movie titles.
I have used TailwinCSS for styles and redux toolkit for redux store management.
I used prettier and eslint for formmating and linting.\
I used jest for unit testing and cypress for e2e testing.\
I used JSON data instead of using the moviedb API.\

### here are some usefull commands to run/test application\
`yarn start` will start the application.\
`yarn build` will create a production build.\
`yarn lint` will run eslint and show errors/warnings in console.\
`yarn lint:fix` will fix linting errors.\
`yarn format` will format the application code using prettier.\
`yarn test` will run a test suit. basically 2 tests. one is unit test and other is a snapshot.\
`npx cypress open` will open cypress e2e test.\
